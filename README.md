## Usage:

For using the default mode (Mode 6), all you need to do is set the baseBet variable and his run.

# Mode 4
Mode 4 is a modified version of the Pluscoup progression system.

There isn't much you need to do to setup the bot to use Mode 4. You may only need to change the 'reserveAmount' variable, and make sure the cashOut variable is something that will hit often. (1.5 for example)

Here is a rough guide for setting the 'reserveAmount' variable.

Let's say your starting balance is 50,000.
Preferably, you would want to have 2 of the reserve balances, this means you can full-bust 2 times and still have enough to continue.

In our case, if we divide 50,000 by 3 we get 16,666.

To be on the safe side, I would suggest you set the 'reserveBalance' 15,000.
This means every time you earn 30k, 15k will be put aside for withdrawing or when you bust.

# Mode 5
Mode 5 is an advanced 10x chaser.

This mode also requires very little setup.

I suggest you keep the 'mode5BaseBet' low as it will only place this once, this will be automatic in the future.
'mode5MinProfit' is all you need to set, this determines how much profit you'll make each win, be careful how high you set it.

# Mode 6
Mode 6 is an advanced 10x chaser with a little feature to help earn quicker.

This mode also requires very little setup.

All you need to change is the baseBet variable, keep in mind, this mode will run at 2x cash out for the initial loss and the one after before chasing a 10x, this helps this mode earn quite well in the green trains.
